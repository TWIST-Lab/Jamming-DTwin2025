# Digital Twins for Identifying Jamming-prone Areas in Smart Cities

This codebase facilitates the simulation of the experiments done for Jamming-prone Areas identification.

## Introduction

This experiment introduces a novel approach for identifying jamming-prone areas in smart cities using ray-tracing (RT) within a digital twin (DT) framework. The methodology integrates Blender for scene creation, NVIDIA's Sionna RT for propagation modeling, and techniques for jamming identification and severity analysis across various areas of the environment.
